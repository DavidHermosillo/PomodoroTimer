The timer starts with a default time of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break.
It does not start counting down until the user presses start.
If you want 0 minutes then you must either enter 0 or enter any number then erase it from the minutes input. The same applies for the seconds.
Changing the time while the timer is running won't affect it until the timer cycles to that timer type.
For example if the work timer is running, then changing the work time won't cause the time to change until the app cycles through break and back into work.
The reset button will set the timer back to the times that are currently entered into the input boxes.
If nothing has been entered in the input boxes since the app was started then the timer will reset to the default values.
